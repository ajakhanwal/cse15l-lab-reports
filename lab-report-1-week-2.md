1. Setting up Visual Studio Code:
   - I already had VSCode installed from previous classes but if need be, it can be downloaded from : https://code.visualstudio.com/ for Windows or OSX(Mac)
   - Once downloaded, open the VSCode window
   - It will look something like this

 2. Remotely Connecting :
    - Install OpenSSH for Windows laptop
    - Open a terminal in VSCode and input the command $ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu with zz replaced with the letters in course specific account. 
    - It will then show you a message confirming if you wish to continue connecting. 
    - After saying yes, it will ask for your password. 
    - After all the steps it will look like this in the terminal
