1. Setting up Visual Studio Code:
   - I already had VSCode installed from previous classes but if need be, it can be downloaded from : https://code.visualstudio.com/ for Windows or OSX(Mac)
   - Once downloaded, open the VSCode window
   - It will look something like this

 2. Remotely Connecting :
    - Install OpenSSH for Windows laptop
    - Open a terminal in VSCode and input the command $ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu with zz replaced with the letters in course specific account. 
    - It will then show you a message confirming if you wish to continue connecting. 
    - After saying yes, it will ask for your password. 
    - After all the steps it will look like this in the terminal

4. Moving files with scp
    - Create a file WhereAmI.java on your computer and run it on the terminal using javac and java
    - Next, run this command scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/ on the terminal
    - When prompted for password, enter the same password
    - This copies the file from the client to the server
    - Now log into your remote server using ssh and then run the same commands in the terminal
    - The output of the whole process is shown below

5. Setting an SSH Key
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation using instructions from here set up the SSH key
    - Then copy the public key file to the directory of user account on server
    - Do this by following commands
    - $ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu and $ scp /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:C:\Users\username/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    - After this you will be able to use ssh and scp commands without being asked for password.
